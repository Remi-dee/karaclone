          ‍‍Fx Karasell may amend the Terms from time to time. You should visit
          the Fx Karasell website regularly to check when the Terms were last
          updated (as displayed at the top of this document) and to review the
          current Terms. We will do our best to notify you of any amendments to
          the Terms that we consider likely to materially affect your rights and

        <h2 className=" font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Risk</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-slate-700">
          ‍Before using the Fx Karasell Site, you should ensure that you
          understand the risks involved in buying, selling or trading digital
          currencies. Digital currency markets can be volatile and prices can
          fluctuate significantly, which could result in sudden and significant
          increases or decreases in the value of your assets. This market
          volatility and other risks involved in buying, selling or trading
          digital currencies are explained on the risk warning page of the Fx
          Karasell website. There may be additional risks not identified in
          these Terms or in the risk warning.
          <br></br>
          You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and risk
          tolerance is suitable for buying, selling or trading digital currency.
          You accept and agree that you are solely responsible for any decision
          to buy, sell, trade or otherwise hold or deal with digital currency.

          electronically by posting them on the Fx Karasell Site, emailing them

          You will at all times have available to you the necessary hardware and

        <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-slate-700">
          Fx Karasell implements and maintains the highest standards of Know
          Your Customer (“KYC”) processes and controls as part of our commitment
          to combating fraud and assisting in the prevention of money laundering
          and terrorist financing. While our industry is largely unregulated, Fx
          Karasell voluntarily adheres to local and international compliance
          standards in relation to customer due diligence, as explained on the
          Compliance page of the Fx Karasell website.
          <br></br>
          To ensure we meet these standards, our customers are required to
          provide certain personal details and documents when opening a Fx
          Karasell Account (“Identity Verification”). The nature and extent of
          the Identity Verification required will depend upon which of our
          supported countries you are resident in, and the deposit and
          withdrawal limits that you wish to apply to your Fx Karasell Account.
          In certain circumstances, Fx Karasell may also perform enhanced due
          diligence (“EDD”) procedures in relation to your Fx Karasell Account.
          You accept and agree that you will remain subject to such procedures
          at all times.
          <br></br>
          Fx Karasell reserves the right to, at any time:
          <br></br>
          Restrict or suspend your Fx Karasell Account when we, in our sole
          discretion, consider it necessary to carry out further Identity
          Verification and/or EDD; or terminate your Fx Karasell Account if you
          provide, or we suspect you have provided, false information or refuse
          to provide information we require for Identity Verification and/or
          EDD. You accept and agree that there may be delays in accessing your
          Fx Karasell Account, or in carrying out transactions through your Fx
          Karasell Account, while we undertake any Identity Verification and/or
          EDD procedures.
          <br></br>
          Retention of information. Fx Karasell is required to retain certain
          information and documentation obtained as part of the Identity
          Verification and EDD procedures. These requirements apply even when
          you have terminated your relationship with Fx Karasell. We reserve the
          right to keep such information and documentation for the required
          period and you accept and agree that information and documentation you
          provide to Fx Karasell may be retained by us, including following the
          closure of your Fx Karasell Account.
